## Quick Start

For developers new to the project, start with the [Architecture Overview](./architecture/README.md) to understand the system's design and key components.

## Diagrams

All architectural diagrams are created using [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) for consistency and maintainability. Diagrams can be viewed in GitHub's built-in Mermaid renderer or in any Mermaid-compatible viewer.
